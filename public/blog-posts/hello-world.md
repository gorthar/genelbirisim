import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function WelcomeMessage({ username }) {
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState("");
  useEffect(() => {
    const timeOfDay = new Date().getHours();
    const message =
      timeOfDay < 12
        ? "Good morning"
        : timeOfDay < 18
        ? "Good afternoon"
        : "Good evening";
    setGreeting(`${message}, ${username}!`);
  }, [username]);
  return (
    <div className="welcome-message">
      <h2>{greeting}</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my tech blog!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
export default WelcomeMessage;
